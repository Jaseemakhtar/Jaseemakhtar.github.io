        Assalamualaikum, I'm <strong>Jaseem Akhtar</strong> — a software engineer who loves 
        building things that move, both on screens and in the real world. With over 5 years of 
        professional experience in Android development, my journey slowly expanded into 
        robotics, embedded systems, electronics, PCB design, and mathematical UI engineering. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve always been fascinated by how ideas transform into reality using engineering. 
        From childhood cardboard inventions to advanced software architectures I design today, 
        the joy has always been in <em>creating something from scratch</em>.
      </p>

        One of the highlights of my engineering journey is the quadruped robot I built entirely 
        from scratch — electronics, firmware, PCB, 3D design, inverse kinematics, and even a 
        control UI developed using Android and Jetpack Compose. It started as a hobby project 
        but evolved into a deeper learning experience in robotics, motion control, and system design.

        In Android, I specialize in complex, mathematically advanced UI systems — custom canvas 
        graphics, non-standard components, transitions, animations, and advanced Compose-driven 
        rendering. My experience includes migrating legacy apps, building design systems, 
        refactoring architectures, and designing pixel-perfect, high-performance screens for 
        high-scale apps.

      <p>
        Over time, I realized that the common thread between Android, graphics, and robotics 
        is <strong>mathematical thinking</strong>. Whether it’s a Bézier animation curve, 
        a servo motion profile, or a coordinate transformation in Compose — everything follows 
        the same principles of geometry, motion, structure, and logic. This realization shaped 
        my engineering identity: someone who bridges UI + firmware + hardware + math.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I’m aiming to transition into more research-driven roles in robotics and 
        system engineering — places where creativity meets engineering rigor. I’m particularly 
        passionate about real-time control systems, mechanical behavior, embedded optimization, 
        and interactive graphics.
