          <p>
            <span class="lead-in">Maker at heart</span>
            I’m often described as an engineer or a hobbyist with <strong>strong technical skills </strong>, but at <strong>heart</strong> I’ve always been a <strong>maker</strong>, long before I knew what engineering even was.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a <strong>child</strong>, I loved <strong>art</strong>, <strong>crafts</strong> and <strong>drawing</strong>. I spent countless
            hours <strong>building</strong> cars, planes, satellites, sliding phones, and even crude
            robots out of <strong>cardboard</strong>, trying to replicate real-world shapes as
            accurately as I could. I wasn’t following instructions, I was visualizing
            how things should look and fit together, then figuring out how to make
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            That instinct never really left.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="curiosity-before-curriculum">

          <p>
            <span class="lead-in">Curiosity before curriculum</span>
            Alongside making things, I was deeply <strong>fascinated</strong> by <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>science</strong>.
            I was the kid who grew up watching <strong>Discovery Channel</strong>, <strong>National Geographic</strong>,
            and science-fiction movies and cartoons; constantly curious about
            <strong>electronic gadgets</strong>, futuristic devices, and <strong>robots</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            That curiosity naturally led me to pursue <strong>Computer Science</strong>. I genuinely
            enjoyed almost every subject, but I never limited my learning to the
            curriculum or to what was taught in class. I <strong>studied</strong> most topics on my <strong>own</strong> by
            reading books, <strong>experimenting</strong>, and breaking things until I understood
            them.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="learning-by-building">

          <p>
            <span class="lead-in">Learning by building</span>
            Once I learned to program, I deliberately invested time in areas that
            weren’t part of the syllabus. I bought an Arduino, worked with servos, and
            explored electronics just to get hands-on exposure beyond software.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even before completing my bachelor’s degree, I was able to build <strong>websites</strong>
            and <strong>Android apps</strong> independently (without perfect software practices at the
            time, of course). This naturally led me into <strong>freelancing</strong>: fixing bugs,
            enhancing features, and building small applications for real users.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="from-experiments-to-real-systems">

          <p>
            <span class="lead-in">From experiments to real systems</span>
            I carried the same self-driven approach into my <strong>master’s</strong> program. My
            professors <strong>recognized</strong> my <strong>curiosity</strong> and effort and were incredibly
            <strong>supportive</strong>. They encouraged me, invited me to take sessions for senior
            students, and students from other departments often approached me for help
            with their projects. I remain deeply grateful for that trust and
            mentorship. Shout out to Professor Dr. <strong>Shivanand Gornale</strong>, Dr. <strong>Parshuram Bannigidad</strong>,
            Dr. <strong>Arun Kumar</strong>, Dr. <strong>Mallamma Reddy</strong>, Dr. <strong>Namita Portraj</strong>, etc. :)
          </p>

          <p>
            During my final semester, which focused on <strong>internships</strong>, I began exploring
            opportunities even before the term officially started. I was fortunate to
            connect with people who <strong>recognized</strong> my work and <strong>offered</strong> me meaningful
            opportunities. What helped me stand out was an <strong>Android file-sharing app</strong> I
            had built and <strong>open-sourced</strong> on GitHub.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team I joined worked on ambitious products: a highly advanced dialer
            app with non-standard UI, rich animations, and features like co-browsing,
            shopping, music playback, and WebRTC-based video calls. Over time, it
            evolved into a reaction platform for YouTube videos and later into a
            content-sharing app that rewarded users for engagement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working on such systems gave me <strong>deep exposure</strong> to <strong>complex</strong>, <strong>real-world</strong>
            problems. I worked closely with senior engineers as well as independently,
            building technically <strong>challenging</strong>, non-standard interactive UI components.
            Over time, I naturally became the <strong>go-to</strong> person for <strong>complex UI</strong> and
            <strong>graphics-heavy interactions</strong>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="from-pixels-to-physical-systems">

          <p>
            <span class="lead-in">From pixels to physical systems</span>
            Later in my career, my interest in building physical things resurfaced. I
            invested in a <strong>3D printer</strong> and began thinking more seriously about the
            connection between <strong>software</strong> and the <strong>physical world</strong>.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If math and logic can move pixels on a screen, why can’t they move
              physical systems the same way?
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            That question led me to build a simple <strong>2-DOF robotic arm</strong>. Experiencing
            something move physically (driven by code and math) was deeply
            <strong>satisfying</strong>. From there, I expanded my electronics knowledge through
            <strong>textbooks</strong> and <strong>hands-on</strong> experimentation, eventually moving into bare-metal
            <strong>microcontroller</strong> programming using <strong>AVR</strong>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="foundations-and-direction">

          <p>
            <span class="lead-in">Foundations and direction</span>
            Fundamentals matters more to me and I enjoy learning things from the <strong>ground up</strong>,
            so that when I’m <strong>building</strong> something simple or complex, I can <strong>reason</strong> through problems
            and know what's possible and what's not; rather than working <strong>blindly</strong>.
            Whether it’s software, UI systems, or physical machines, I’m
            most motivated when I can understand <em>why</em> something works, not
            just <em>how</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the core, I’m someone who enjoys understanding systems <strong>deeply</strong> and
            building things — whether they live on a screen or move in the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, I’m actively learning mathematics (calculus, <strong>
              linear
              algebra
            </strong>, and <strong>differential equations</strong>), <strong>embedded</strong> systems and <strong>Robotics</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m aiming to transition into more research-driven roles in robotics and
            system engineering — places where creativity meets engineering rigor. I’m particularly
            passionate about real-time control systems, mechanical behavior, embedded optimization,
            and interactive graphics.
